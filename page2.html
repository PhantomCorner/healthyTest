              The Kids Early Years Network (KEYS) brings together services in
              Western Sydney for families with young children who may need
              additional support due to the impacts of adverse events in
              childhood and the socio-economic determinants of health. By the
              time children begin school in Australia, their health and
              developmental outcomes have already been impacted by the
              circumstances they live in. KEYS is a multi-agency program that
              targets the 20% of families in Western Sydney with children aged
              0-5 years that are at risk of poor outcomes and aims to change the
              trajectory for the whole family. KEYS is unique in that it works
              with the trusted service providers already working with families,
              offering specialist knowledge and new areas of expertise as
              adjuncts to the activities already in place.

              Since its inception, KEYS has worked with over 1000 services
              across 500 organisations in Western Sydney to help families
              achieve their goals. Our KEYS partners include the Department of
              Communities and Justice, The Sydney Children's Hospitals Network,
              Western Sydney Local Health District and the Department of
              Education.

              In the last year, KEYS has implemented a new software system that
              has enhanced the ability of our partners to collaborate with each
              other. To provide culturally-appropriate and holistic services in
              Western Sydney, the team also includes a dedicated Disability
              Specialist Navigator, employed through The Sydney Children's
              Hospitals Network, a Housing Navigator and an identified
              Aboriginal Navigator.
